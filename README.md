I decided to create an ajax call using jQuery to get all of my response information into one json object that I can use to multiply by the amount of EUR that I speficy. In hindsight, I probably shouldve done something that I knew I could do within the time frame, but that's too late I guess. I used the <select> tag to create a dropdown menu and filled that out using AJAX.
