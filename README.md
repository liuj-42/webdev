> Every lab you turn in will have a README.md file. This file will contain a running work log of everything you did for this lab. I especially want to know where you got stuck along the way and what you did to get out of being stuck. One to two sentences isn’t going to cut it here: this is the only opportunity you are going to get to document your own progression so take it seriously. At the end of the semester, I should be able to read through all the README.md files and have a good idea of your growth--as should you!

I don't think that I particularly struggled on anything this lab, as I had pretty much done the same before in Intro to ITWS as my second lab. However, I challenged myself to not use a template and instead try to build my resume from scratch, which I spent a fair amount of time on. I had trouble with figuring out a way to have left-aligned and right-aligned text on the same line and how to center align two elements that I had in a div, but other than that this was mostly review and I just spent some time derusting from my lack of use of html/css over the summer. I never knew about the h-cards that I had to add, so that was interesting to look at and have a little insight in how some apis/web scrapers work. I will definitely use this resume that I created in the future at least for a bit, as I do enjoy how it looks.

> Additionally, you must cite any tutorials/walkthroughs/YouTube videos/etc. that you used to create both the group portfolio and your personal portfolio. Plagiarism is no good! If you looked at it, you drop the link in your cited sources list. Simple as that. Failure to cite all referenced works will result in a zero for the assignment and a full letter drop in your final grade. When in doubt, email me or the TA.
