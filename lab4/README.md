> Every lab you turn in will have a README.md file. This file will contain a running work log of everything you did for this lab. I especially want to know where you got stuck along the way and what you did to get out of being stuck. One to two sentences isnâ€™t going to cut it here: this is the only opportunity you are going to get to document your own progression so take it seriously. At the end of the semester, I should be able to read through all the README.md files and have a good idea of your growth--as should you!

I spent the most amount of time tinkering with the javascript, because I had never had a formal class on that language or anything. I was learning as I went, and this was the first time that I had used an api call with ajax too. I was in charge of making the 3rd sign up page and also implmenting the weather widget for each page. The form was simple enough, I spent some time learning how to make custom radio buttons that were actually just spans that changed your cursor on hover, and I also made some javascript to make only relavant parts of the form show up depending on what was selected. The api call was all new to me, but I worked with the example ajax task we had in class last week to figure out how to work it out. Overall I enjoyed the lab, there were moments where I got stuck (espicially with figuring out how the data from the api call was stored) but in the end I'm pretty happy with what I made.

> Additionally, you must cite any tutorials/walkthroughs/YouTube videos/etc. that you used to create both the group portfolio and your personal portfolio. Plagiarism is no good! If you looked at it, you drop the link in your cited sources list. Simple as that. Failure to cite all referenced works will result in a zero for the assignment and a full letter drop in your final grade. When in doubt, email me or the TA.
