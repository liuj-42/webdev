        <div class="dialog" title="Article I Annotations" id='dialog1_content'>
            <p>Article 1 of the constitution is the foundation for the legislative branch of our government and the congress. This branch has the job of creating new laws or legislation. The article makes the branch bicameral which means it has two groups (bodies) : the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article 1 contains important procedures in the legislative branch such as passing laws which must be passed by the House of Representatives, Senate, and finally the president. This is why it’s very important for people to vote for the people they want in government because they will be creating the laws that we have to follow every day.</p>

    <h3>Article II</h3>
    <div>
        <div class="dialog" title="Article II Annotations" id='dialog2_content'>
            <p>Article 2 sets the foundation of the executive branch of our government, the branch that the US president is a part of. Article 2 gives the president the power to serve as the head of the executive branch for 4 years which gives the president powers such as being the head of our military and being able to recommend laws. The article also goes through the process of how the president gets elected and how government officials can be impeached or removed from office for serious crimes. The president is one of the most important and prominent figures in our government. It is important to understand how he/she comes to power with the help of our votes and how he/she can also be removed if a serious offense is committed by them.</p>

The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President.

        <p>The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.</p>
        <p>No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.</p>
        <p>In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.</p>
        <p>The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.</p>

        <p>He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.</p>
        <p>The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.</p>

        <h3>Section 3</h3>
        <p>He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.</p>

    <h3>Article III</h3>
    <div>
        <div class="dialog" title="Article III Annotations" id='dialog3_content'>
            <p>Article 3 sets the foundation for the judicial branch of our government. Article 3 creates the Supreme court which is the most powerful court in the judicial branch. In the judicial branch all judges can keep their jobs for the rest of their lives as long as they are found guilty of crimes. This allows judges to be independent and make decisions they feel are right. The supreme court can create minor courts and can only interpret the laws but not create or change any. The judicial branch is very important as they determine how our laws are interpreted and how people can be punished for breaking the laws.</p>

    <h3>Article V</h3>
    <div>
        <div class="dialog" title="Article V Annotations" id='dialog5_content'>
            <p>Article 5 explains how the constitution itself can be changed from its current wording. When creating the constitution the founders knew that they had not finished the full document and that the constitution would need to change over time. In fact, just to have the constitution accepted the first 10 amendments had to be passed to please some states. Based on the article, there are two ways to amend the Constitution. The first is that an amendment can be proposed from the House or Senate and then must be approved by the state legislatures.
                The second method is for a state or a group of states to call for a constitutional convention, and for both houses to approve this proposal of Congress. For an amendment to be passed it must go through the House and Senate by a two-thirds majority and then be ratified by three-quarters of state legislatures (38 states). The Article makes it complicated to pass amendments as there are so many legislators it must pass through. This is so that the amendments will be well thought and important if they will actually be passed. As a result the constitution has only been amended 27 times total.

    <h3>Article VI</h3>
    <div>
        <div class="dialog" title="Article VI Annotations" id='dialog6_content'>
            <p>Article six’s main purpose is to state that the constitution is supreme in establishing law and treaties. The Article is referred to as the supremacy clause because it states that the constitution is the “supreme law of the land.” No states are above the federal laws and constitution and cannot create laws that contradict either. The article also states that the US will pay off debts from before the constitution was created. Article 6 also guarantees religious freedom within the U.S. government. This article overall states that no one is above the constitution and the laws made by the federal gov’t. This is important because it means no one can go against these laws, for example no state or person can take away your right to practice your religion in the U.S.</p>

        <p>All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.</p>
        <p>This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.</p>

    <h3>Article VII</h3>
    <div>
        <div class="dialog" title="Article VII Annotations" id='dialog7_content'>
            <p> Article 7 was created in order to make the constitution the supreme law of the land and to explain how a state can ratify (give formal consent to the constitution) it. Article 7 made it so that only nine out of the original thirteen states were needed to ratify the Constitution to make it apply throughout the U.S. It took two and half years for all 13 to ratify the constitution. This was a very important step in the identity of the U.S. gov’t as the gov’t could have simply forced the constitution on the people but instead left it up to the people by giving them (the states) a voice in whether or not the constitution would become official.</p>

</div>

<div class="dialog" title="First Amendment Annotations" id='dialog8_content'>
    <p>The first amendment gives you Freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition. This stops Congress from being able to restrict people's religion. It guarantees you to be able to speak freely and petition the government (peacefully).</p>
</div>

<div class="dialog" title="Second Amendment Annotations" id='dialog9_content'>
    <p>This amendment allows people the right to keep and bear arms for the preservation of life, liberty, and property. Although the amendment says a “well regulated militia,” the amendment has been interpreted as protecting the rights of individuals to have arms for self defense not for states to maintain militias. </p>
</div>

<div class="dialog" title="Third Amendment Annotations" id='dialog10_content'>
    <p>Amendment 3 says that soldiers cannot stay in people's homes without their consent. During the revolutionary war the british used to force their way into people’s homes and demand food and housing. To prevent this amendment 3 was passed and it essentially guarantees peoples right to privacy nowadays.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialog" title="Fourth Amendment Annotations" id='dialog11_content'>
    <p>Amendment 4 gives people the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. This means that police/government employees cannot search you or your home without a warrant or probable cause. In certain cases this amendment does not apply such as at the airport where you must be searched in order to board a flight. This law is important as it protects your privacy unless it is warranted based on solid evidence. For example police cannot search/enter your home without a warrant given by a judge or your permission.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialog" title="Fifth Amendment Annotations" id='dialog12_content'>
    <p>The 5th amendment states that you have the right to due process of law, freedom from self-incrimination, double jeopardy and that private property cannot be taken away without compensation (pay). Double jeopardy means that you are protected from being tried for the same crime more than once. You can also “plead the fifth” which means you choose not to speak or testify against yourself in trial. Due process guarantees you a fair trial and you are also required to have your Miranda rights given to you by the police before they question you. This is also to prevent self-incrimination. </p>

    <p>Amendment 6 gives accused persons the right to a speedy and fair trial, public trial, and a lawyer. Speedy trial  means that the gov’t cannot purposely delay a trial. Public trial means that the gov’t cannot hold secret trials that are unknown to the public. If an accused person cannot afford a lawyer in court the gov’t will provide a lawyer known as a public defender. It is also required for witnesses to testify in court so that they can be questioned, this is called a subpoena ( a writ ordering a person to attend court).</p>

    <p>Amendment 7 is Trial by jury is certain civil cases (non criminal). Civil cases are cases not involving serious crimes, such as discrimination lawsuits or people suing each other. A trial by jury is when a select group of people hear the case and decide if the defendant is guilty. This was done to limit the power of the gov’t as judges may tend to side with the gov’t.</p>

    <p>Amendment 8 prohibits excessive fines or bans and prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.

    <p>Amendment 9 states that the rights not specifically granted to the people in the Bill of Rights, still belong to the people. This amendment basically means that just because certain things are not listed on the bill of rights doesn’t mean the gov’t can take those rights away from you. This amendment is broad and can apply to many things for example the right to eat food and drink water or the right to get a job are not listed but are rights that we obviously have.</p>

    <p>Amendment 10 states that any powers that aren't either given to the national government or denied to the state government belongs to the state. The federal government has all the powers given by the constitution but the other powers then trickle down the states and people. This amendment was created to balance out the powers between the state and federal governments. An example includes the federal government's power to control the armed forces while the states have the power of the police and fire departments. Some other state powers are holding elections, issuing drivers licenses, and public education (schools).</p>
