# lab 7
This is the readme file for the seventh lab of Web Systems & Development class.
RCSID: liuj42
Link to repo for this class: https://github.com/liuj-42/webdev
> Every lab you turn in will have a README.md file. This file will contain a running work log of everything you did for this lab. I especially want to know where you got stuck along the way and what you did to get out of being stuck. One to two sentences isnâ€™t going to cut it here: this is the only opportunity you are going to get to document your own progression so take it seriously. At the end of the semester, I should be able to read through all the README.md files and have a good idea of your growth--as should you!

I got a lot of experience learning how to do various SQL queries and also using mysqli and prepared statements for SQL queries using PHP. In part 2, I spent the longest with number 8 because I was having a hard time using inner join, but after I got it I was able to use it for part 3 when displaying the average grade for each course and the number of students in each course. Instead of listing the courses by CRN, I instead used inner join to show the course names which I thought was pretty cool.
Overall I think this lab helped me a lot with understanding how to integrate databases with PHP and I will use this knowledge I learned for my final project.

```sql
SELECT courses.title, avg(grades.grade) 
FROM grades INNER JOIN COURSES 
ON grades.crn = courses.crn 
GROUP BY courses.crn

SELECT courses.title, COUNT(*) 
FROM grades INNER JOIN courses 
ON grades.crn = courses.crn 
GROUP BY courses.crn

> Additionally, you must cite any tutorials/walkthroughs/YouTube videos/etc. that you used to create both the group portfolio and your personal portfolio. Plagiarism is no good! If you looked at it, you drop the link in your cited sources list. Simple as that. Failure to cite all referenced works will result in a zero for the assignment and a full letter drop in your final grade. When in doubt, email me or the TA.
