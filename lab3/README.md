This is the readme file for the third lab of Web Systems & Development class. 
RCSID: liuj42

> Every lab you turn in will have a README.md file. This file will contain a running work log of everything you did for this lab. I especially want to know where you got stuck along the way and what you did to get out of being stuck. One to two sentences isnâ€™t going to cut it here: this is the only opportunity you are going to get to document your own progression so take it seriously. At the end of the semester, I should be able to read through all the README.md files and have a good idea of your growth--as should you!

the first day I worked on the header and adding a dropdown menu when hovering over the programs sections
I plan on adding icons of the social media buttons as links in the header in the future too
I decided to mostly follow the theme of the old ITWS site, but with some differences in the colors and content. 
For the graduate/undergraduate programs pages, I also had an accordian for each of the topics for the graduate/undergraduate parts. I spent some time trying to modify the css for the accordion widgets in the jQuery css file, but eventually I just didn't import it in my html file and decided to keep the style as minimal as possible. I learned about the sub and sup tags, which I used as pseudo-footnotes.
As for the faculty page, I decided to try to use AJAX and jQuery to display the data on this page. In hindsight, it probably would've been a better idea to do this with the news section, as I had to omit lots of contact information for the professors (the only contact info that was the same accross all of the faculty members was their email). As a side note, the lab instructions to include the ITWS linkedin but the only one that was listed in the faculty info section on the ITWS page was professor Plotka's, so I just linked that.
As for the contact page, I just made a simple form with some inputs and a textarea. I inplemented form validation with a javascript and while debugging the function I wrote, I learned a little bit about the console and using it. In the end, the majority of the problems that I had were from typos. I didn't actually make the form do anything on success, as I the little information about sending emails seems to be very complicated.
For the news portion of the website, I just copied the first 5 new articles that were linked on the news page of the ITWS page. Prior to this, I actually didn't use float that much, and in order to make the page to my liking, I made the images float:left so the text would wrap around them.
Lastly, for the home page, I didn't make the content that much different from the ITWS page. I defeinitely left a lot of things out, but that's because it was really redundant with the content found in the other pages and I felt like they weren't needed that much. The header is consistent accross all of the subpages, and has links to each of the subpages alongside with icons of social media that the ITWS program is part of. The footer has a lot of inspiration from the ITWS page, and has the address of the ITWS program and some general information.

> Additionally, you must cite any tutorials/walkthroughs/YouTube videos/etc. that you used to create both the group portfolio and your personal portfolio. Plagiarism is no good! If you looked at it, you drop the link in your cited sources list. Simple as that. Failure to cite all referenced works will result in a zero for the assignment and a full letter drop in your final grade. When in doubt, email me or the TA.

As for tutorials, I learned how to use tables for the first time. I used this link: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_table_center.asp on how to format them and this one on how to make them: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asphttps://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp
I also had changed my cursor when hovering over one of the headers at one point and had to reuse that header, so I had to do some stuff with changing the cursor that I found from this link: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_cursor
In the end, I just made a class that when hovered the cursor would become a pointer instead.
I used this stackoverflow thread https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20505008/css-property-to-pad-text-inside-of-div to figure out how to add internal padding for divs, and this one for how to use float: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19179424/how-to-wrap-text-around-an-image-using-html-css/19179519
I referred to this link a couple of times just to make sure that I was using the right display: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp, and this one on veritically aligning things in a div: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/924282/why-is-vertical-aligntext-top-not-working-in-css
Lastly, I used this link while debugging my javascript function: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
